# Adam Saunders professional website

Professional website for Adam Saunders. See [saundersresearch.github.io](saundersresearch.github.io) for more.

To start, install ruby and bundle. Then add `bundle add github-pages` to start. Add the remote theme with instructions at [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#remote-theme-method) and then it should be working.

After editing files in markdown, open Git Bash. Run `cd /PATH/TO/FOLDER` to navigate to this directory. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` to build the website locally.
