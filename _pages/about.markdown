My name is Adam Saunders. As a graduate student at Vanderbilt University in the [MASI Lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/), I challenge myself to learn more about the world of medical imaging. My goal is to learn more from often imperfectly-acquired medical images, rooted in the idea that the pixels represent not just a picture, but a person. I have a passion for research and scientific communication, and I am working to earn a PhD. I am a member of the Vanderbilt Lab for Immersive AI Translation [(VALIANT)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/valiant/), a multidisciplinary center of labs who work to translate AI from foundational research to application. I firmly believe that leveraging the tools of AI and machine learning is key to creating powerful, accessible, and accurate medical technologies. 

I've also performed research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory through the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Intern (SULI) Program, using what was then one of the fastest computers in the world to perform cancer detection and classification from histological whole-slide images at a massive scale. I attended the University of Dayton, where I presented on an undergraduate honors thesis studying diabetic retinopathy detection using deep learning in one of the first TED Talk-style presentations at the annual Stander Symposium.

Outside of the classroom and the lab, I am a musician. I have worked as a piano accompanist for theater auditions, liturgical choirs, and orchestras. I compose instrumental and vocal music for liturgical and concert settings.
