I am a PhD student at Vanderbilt University in the [MASI Lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/). I'm passionate about medical imaging and AI. My goal research focuses on how we can learn more from imperfectly-acquired brain MRI. I am a member of the Vanderbilt Lab for Immersive AI Translation [(VALIANT)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/valiant/). I believe that AI and machine learning is key for complementing available information in images, and it will help us create powerful, accessible, and accurate medical technologies. 

I've also performed research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory through the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Intern (SULI) Program, using what was then one of the fastest computers in the world to perform cancer detection and classification from histological whole-slide images at a massive scale. I attended the University of Dayton, where I presented on an undergraduate honors thesis studying diabetic retinopathy detection using deep learning in one of the first TED Talk-style presentations at the annual Stander Symposium.

Outside of the classroom and the lab, I am a musician. I have worked as a piano accompanist for theater auditions, liturgical choirs, and orchestras. I compose instrumental and vocal music for liturgical and concert settings. I also enjoy knitting and crochet.
