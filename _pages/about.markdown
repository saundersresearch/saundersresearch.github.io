My name is Adam Saunders. As a graduate of electrical engineering at the University of Dayton, where I've discovered a passion for challenging myself to solve difficult problems. I love learning more about the world of electrical engineering, and that's why I aim to get a PhD as an incoming graduate student at Vanderbilt University.

I have performed research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory using machine learning to classify medical images. Back at UD, I am working on an honors thesis in the same field. I firmly believe that leveraging the tools of AI and machine learning is the key to creating powerful, accessible, and accurate medical technologies.

While at the University of Dayton, I have worked as a teaching assistant for an introductory physics course. This class can be very challenging for new students, so it's my job to empower them to solve problems on their own. It's not always an easy task â€“ I often find myself learning more when students ask me questions! I also serve as the vice president of the student branch of the IEEE on campus.

Outside of work and the classroom, you can find me playing music. I've played in groups like the University of Dayton Orchestra as a violist and a piano accompanist. I also have accompanied Masses on campus and even composed music for liturgies on campus. I hope to accompany a musical in the future!
