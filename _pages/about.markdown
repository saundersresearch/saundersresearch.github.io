My name is Adam Saunders. As a graduate student at Vanderbilt University, I challenge myself to learn more about the world of medical imaging. As an electrical engineer, I work as a member of the MASI Lab to apply what I learn to improve our medical imaging technologies and make our world a healthier place. I have a passion for research and scientific communication, and I am actively working to earn a PhD and become a full-time researcher. I firmly believe that leveraging the tools of AI and machine learning is key to creating powerful, accessible, and accurate medical technologies. 

In the past, I performed research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory using deep learning with high-performance computers to classify whole-slide images for cancer detection. This research won Best Poster in the Computing and Computational Sciences Directorate at the 2022 Summer Intern Symposium. I also worked on an undergraduate honors thesis at the University of Dayton, where I studied image processing methods to increase the accuracy of diabetic retinopathy detection from fundus images. I presented my findings in a TED Talk-style presentation as one of four featured honors thesis writers at the annual Stander Symposium.

Outside of the classroom and the lab, I am a musician. I play the piano and viola, and I have worked as a piano accompanist for theater auditions, liturgical choirs, and orchestras. In addition, I compose instrumental and vocal music for liturgical and concert settings. I aim to become a piano accompanist for musical theater in the future, and I hope to make my compositions available online in the future.
