Currently, my research focuses on applying deep learning algorithms to medical image processing. During the summer of 2022, I performed research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory with the [Multimodal Data Analytics Group](https://www.ornl.gov/group/multimodal-data-analytics). During the school year, I perform research under the mentorship of [Dr. Russell Hardie](https://udayton.edu/directory/engineering/electrical_and_computer/hardie_russell.php) at the University of Dayton.

Whole-slide imaging is a new imaging modality that allows cancer pathologists to analyze tissue samples digitally instead of on glass slides. This change allows for the application of machine learning methods. However, due to the gigapixel-scale resolution required for whole-slide imaging, designing machine learning models is very difficult. Our research focuses on multiple-instance learning, a technique where we break the image into many smaller patches and use inferences from the patches to classify the entire image. 

Our team at ORNL takes advantage of [Summit](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/), one of the world's fastest supercomputers, to train and analyze deep learning models on a scale that would be unattainable without the power of high performance computing.

# Diabetic retinopathy and super-resolution algorithms (University of Dayton)

Diabetic retinopathy is a disease common in diabetics that can lead to blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. Diagnosis can be tedious, as ophthalmologists must analyze fine details from fundus images of the eyes. However, deep learning algorithms can automate this process. We can improve computer-aided detection systems for diabetic retinopathy by developing algorithms to increase the resolution of the fundus images. Our research here focuses on developing these super-resolution algorithms through the use of CNNs and GANs.
