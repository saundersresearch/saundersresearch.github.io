Here's what's happening in my life currently. See [aboutideasnow.com/about](https://aboutideasnow.com/about).

I'm working on my PhD at Vanderbilt University, where I study medical imaging and AI. I'm done with classes, so now I do research full time. Outside of work, I've been into knitting and crochet. I'm not as involved with music as I used to be, but I still play piano for fun and occasionally write or transcribe music for piano.
