I'm proud to announce I have officially graduated from the University of Dayton! I have graduated with a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. It's been a great few years, and I'm excited for what's next.

I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i>. In addition, I was the recipient of the Thomas R. Armstrong Award of Excellence for Outstanding Electrical Engineering Achievement. Along with my twin brother Nick, I also received the Department of Music's Senior Award for Outstanding Collaborative Pianist. I was very honored to receive these awards, and I think they highlight one of the main reasons I first chose to attend UD - I worked hard to study engineering while also continuing to include music in my life. I hope to be able to continue incorporating music into my life, especially as a piano accompanist. 

The next step for me is moving to Nashville to begin a PhD program at Vanderbilt University! I'm super excited to continue performing medical imaging research. I'm overwhelmed with gratitude for everyone who has helped get me to this point. The journey to becoming an electrical engineer has not been easy, but it has certainly been worth it!
