I'm excited to share that I have accepted a PhD offer from Vanderbilt University! I will be joining the [Medical-image Analysis and Statistical Interpretation (MASI) Lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/) under Dr. Bennett Landman.

This lab is a part of [Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/), an exciting, cross-disciplinary set of labs that works in the intersection between medicine, computer science, engineering, and more. So, I'll officially be a part of the newly-formed Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and I will also have the chance to work alongside people across disciplinary boundaries.

I'm ready to move to Nashville and continuing pursuing my goal of earning a PhD!
